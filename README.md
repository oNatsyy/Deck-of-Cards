# Deck-of-Cards
A Deck of Cards game created due to excessive boredom in summer vacations.

Rules of the game:

Same suits, greater card value will earn you a point.
Different suits will always result in no points awarded to both players.

Progress:

Implementation is not yet complete so the game only supports two players.
Read docstrings and comments in the py files to understand the purpose of each class and method.
