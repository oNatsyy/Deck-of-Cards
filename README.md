# Deck-of-Cards
A Deck of Cards game created due to excessive boredom in summer vacations.

Rules of the game:

Same suits, greater card value will earn you a point.
Different suits will always result in no points awarded to both players.
Suits and value must be entered the same way as they show up in your deck as the game does not check for case.

Progress:

Implementation is not yet complete so the game only supports two players.
Read docstrings and comments in the py files to understand the purpose of each class and method.
